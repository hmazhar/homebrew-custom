custom formulas for osx homebrew

#Partio
this formula will install partio from the git repo instead of the release archive.

```
brew install https://raw.github.com/hmazhar/homebrew/master/partio.rb --HEAD

Alternatively the formula can be tapped and installed using 

brew tap hmazhar/custom
brew install --HEAD hmazhar/custom/partio
```
